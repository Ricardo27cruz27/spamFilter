<p>Concern about the proliferation of unsolicited bulk email, commonly
referred to as <i>spam</i>, has been steadily increasing. When received
in small quantities, spam may annoy recipients, but rarely poses a significant
problem. However, some recipients of large quantities of spam find themselves
so overwhelmed with unwanted email that it is time-consuming or difficult
for them to ferret out their desired correspondence. Furthermore, unlike
most "junk" postal mail, junk email frequently contains explicit sexual
language and attached photographs that many recipients find offensive.
With the advent of HTML-enabled email clients, some bulk emailers now send
lengthy HTML-formatted email, complete with images and links to Java applets
that may execute automatically when the email is read using some clients.

</p><p>As spam recipients become increasingly annoyed, Internet Service Providers
(ISPs) have been deluged with complaints. Furthermore, some ISPs report
that spam places a considerable burden on their systems.

</p><p>A variety of technical countermeasures to spam have been proposed: the
simplest are already being implemented; some of the more extreme could
require dramatic changes to the ways we communicate electronically. In
addition, there has been growing support in the U.S. for laws that would
restrict the sending of spam. In this article we examine the spam problem
and discuss the probable long-term effectiveness of current and proposed
technical countermeasures as well as possible regulatory solutions.
</p><center>
<h2>
THE PROBLEM</h2></center>
Prior to the commercialization of the Internet in the mid-1990s, the spam
problem was quite limited. Unsolicited email consisted mostly of messages from pranksters,
chain letters, and inappropriate messages sent to established email lists
by individuals who were either unaware that their message would go to the
entire list or unaware that their messages were inappropriate for that
forum. However, unsolicited <i>commercial</i> email messages were quite
rare. Nonetheless, unwanted email messages were recognized as a problem
in an Internet Request For Comments as early as 1975 (Postel) and in the
pages of <i>CACM</i> as early as 1982 (Denning).

<p>After large-scale commercial spam made its public debut on Usenet in
the infamous Canter and Siegel "green card lawyers" incident of 1994 (Campbell
1994), the proliferation of unsolicited commercial email began to pick
up speed. By the spring of 1996 spam made up a significant portion of the
email received by customers of the major Internet service providers, and
some providers began to take action. In June 1997 the US Federal Trade
Commission held hearings on spam that resulted in the launching of a "Scamspam"
effort to go after the senders of fraudulent spam and in the creation of
an ad-hoc working group to address the issue (FTC 1997).

</p><p>According to Jill Lesser, a lawyer for America On-Line (AOL), before
technical countermeasures were actively pursued, at times as much of 50%
of the email coming into the AOL system was "spam." At the FTC spam hearings
Lesser reported that during the spring and early summer of 1997, spam rates
on most days hovered near 30%.

</p><p>Our study (<a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#Sidebar%201:%20A%20Case">see sidebar</a>) suggests that
the volume of spam received by AOL may not be indicative of the overall
extent of the problem. Possibly due to the ease with which bulk emailers
can "harvest" the addresses of AOL subscribers (a practice that is against
AOL’s policies), AOL appears to receive an unusually large volume of spam.
By comparison, during July 1997 our study found spam rates around 10% for
a corporate network (selected AT&amp;T and Lucent sub-domains used by employees
of those companies) and spam rates under 2% for a large pure ISP (i.e.
a service provider that offers only Internet access, not online services).

</p><p>While AOL’s spam rates may not be typical, our study indicates that
the spam problem has been increasing rapidly and it may only be a matter of time
before all Internet Service Providers (ISPs) experience similar rates. It remains to be seen whether
technical countermeasures can curb the increasing spam rate over the long
term.

</p><p>In addition to technical countermeasures, some ISPs have sought legal
relief. Early cases centered on attempts by ISPs to block or limit
spam generated by Cyber Promotions, Inc., perhaps the largest generator
of spam on the Internet. In <i>Cyber Promotions, Inc. v. America Online,
Inc.</i>,<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#i.%20948%20F.%20Supp.%20436%20(E.D.%20Pa.%20Nov.%204,">i</a></sup>
Cyber Promotions was found not to have a First Amendment right to send
spam to AOL subscribers and thus AOL could attempt to block such messages
via technical means. Cyber Promotions and Compuserve entered into a consent
decree limiting the methods by which the former could communicate with
the latter’s subscribers<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#ii.CompuServe%20Inc.%20v.%20Cyber%20Promotions,%20Inc.,%20No.">ii</a></sup>.
(Cyber Promotions entered into similar agreements with Prodigy<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#iii.Prodigy%20Services%20Corp.%20v.%20Cyber%20Promotions,">iii</a></sup>
and Concentric Networks<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#iv.%20Concentric%20Network%20Corp.%20v.%20Wallace,%20No.%20C-96">iv</a></sup>.)
More recently, because generators of spam often use false return addresses
containing the trademarked names of other businesses, several ISPs have
sought injunctions preventing the use of their electronic addresses within
spam generated by others<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#v.%20See%20for%20example%20Parker%20v.%20C.N.%20Enterprises,%20No.">v</a></sup>.
</p><h2>
Contributing Factors</h2>
Before discussing possible solutions to the spam problem, it is instructive
to examine the major factors that contribute to the problem: the low price
of bulk email, and cheap pseudonyms.

<p><b>Bulk email is inexpensive to send.</b> Some bulk email services will
send 100,000 email messages for under $200, and do-it-yourselfers can buy
a million email addresses for under $100. A plain vanilla personal computer,
dial-up Internet account, and free email client software will do for the
amateur bulk mailer. But serious bulk mailers invest a few hundred dollars
in specialized software capable of sending 250,000 messages with forged
headers per hour and harvesting email addresses from Usenet, the Web, and
online services. After making the initial investment in a personal computer
and software, a bulk mailer can send out hundreds of thousands of messages
a day with minimal work and monthly service fees. With such low expenses,
bulk mailers can recoup their costs even if only a tiny fraction of the
messages they send out result in sales.

</p><p>However, it is important to remember that while the cost of sending
bulk mail is low, the cost of receiving it may not be. The cost of receiving
a single piece of bulk mail is minimal, but the cost of receiving many
pieces can be considerable. Even if individuals are not paying per-message
or per-minute fees, spam may be expensive in terms of time. Individuals
may waste minutes or hours transferring unwanted messages from their ISPs
to their computers and sorting through those messages once transferred.
Furthermore, unwanted messages place a burden on ISPs, requiring them to
spend time and money implementing filters, responding to subscriber complaints,
and increasing their email system capacity more frequently than would otherwise
be necessary. In addition many ISPs are burdened by spam not destined for
their own subscribers, but relayed through their system by spammers who
are attempting to hide the true origin of their messages. One ISP estimated
that before installing anti-relay technology in March 1997, 15% of their
total mail traffic was relayed spam.

</p><p><b>Pseudonyms are inexpensive to obtain.</b> The most straightforward
techniques for filtering unwanted email involve filtering messages based
on the name or address of the sender. But it is inexpensive for senders
to obtain new valid or forged email addresses, phone numbers, post office
boxes, or other identifiers that serve as pseudonyms in cyberspace. As
long as their business does not rely on building a positive reputation
over time, it costs bulk mailers little to repeatedly change pseudonyms,
thus thwarting many filtering efforts.
</p><center>
<h2>
THE SOLUTIONS</h2></center>
In this section we discuss the current and proposed solutions to the spam
problem. We focus on the technical and regulatory solutions. Legal countermeasures
have also been used with mixed results. When the spam generator has a significant
business presence it may be possible (at the cost of hiring counsel and
filing a lawsuit) for recipient ISPs to pursue restraining orders and injunctions.
These costs can be prohibitive, though, for individual spam recipients.
Furthermore, the advent of do-it-yourself spam kits has encouraged many
small-time bulk emailers who are more difficult to pursue in court. Most
of these small-timers contribute very little to the problem individually,
but together they can churn out huge quantities of spam. Identifying these
senders and suing each one individually is not likely to be practical.

<p><b><font size="+2">Technical solutions</font></b>

</p><p><b>Filtering solutions.</b> Automated and semi-automated filtering solutions
are widely used by ISPs, corporate email administrators, and individuals.
Completely automated solutions bounce or delete all suspected spam, while
semi-automated solutions put suspected spam aside for a human to examine.
The most straightforward filtering solutions involve filtering messages
from known spam senders based on information in message headers. In addition,
pattern matchers can sometimes identify spam based on information within
the body of an email message. Our experience with the use of pattern matchers
on the sub-domains we studied suggests that it is still difficult to use
them with 100 percent accuracy. While an automated filter that misses a
small percentage of spam may be acceptable to most people, fewer people
are likely to accept an automated filter that incorrectly identifies a
small percentage of <i>desired</i> mail as spam. In addition, the presence
of thousands of identical copies of a single message can be an indication
of spam. However, there are some legitimate messages that are sent to thousands
of people – for example, many frequent travelers sign up to receive email
notification of airfare sales -- so automatic filtering based on the number
of recipients also requires some manual supervision. Updating filters and
supervising a semi-automated filter can be a time-consuming endeavor for
an email administrator and too complicated for unsophisticated end users.

</p><p>The manual effort required to facilitate filtering solutions can be
reduced by taking advantage of economies of scale. Once one copy of an
unsolicited commercial message is identified, setting filters to detect
additional copies is easier. Collaborative filtering techniques and systems
for easily sharing filtering lists can reduce the effort required by any
one individual. Furthermore, semi-automated filtering techniques in which
filters are run by administrators but review of suspected spam is done
by each recipient may require less manual effort by an administrator without
substantially increasing the burden on the recipient. However, some semi-automated
solutions may pose problems for individuals who download all of their email
using a modem as they still have to wait for the unwanted mail to download.
This problem is reduced by email systems that allow clients to preview
email headers.

</p><p>Some ISPs have experimented with filters that reject all messages from
non-registered domains. When a message is received for delivery to an account
on the ISP the mail agent tries to resolve the SMTP envelope address in
the inbound message. If the domain name contained within the address does
not have a valid record in the domain name service the message is silently
rejected. Such filtering can weed out messages with deliberately faked
addresses but it may also drop legitimate messages from mis-configured
mail servers. Alternatively, SMTP mail agents could require authenticated
connections for inbound mail; spam messages could then be traced back through
the chain of transfer agents.

</p><p>Some ISPs now perform filtering on outbound messages as well as inbound
messages, or place daily limits on the number of outbound messages each
subscriber can send, in an attempt to prevent their subscribers from contributing
to the spam problem.

</p><p>If bulk emailers do not significantly change their techniques, filtering
solutions will probably become increasingly more successful and less time-consuming
to administer. However, while some bulk mailers continue to use primitive
techniques, many are purchasing increasingly sophisticated software packages
that help them thwart filters. Bulk emailers can increase the difficulty
of detecting their messages by sending out a bulk solicitation in which
the message sent to each recipient has been customized or otherwise modified
so that the messages are not identical. Furthermore, sophisticated bulk
mailers might try other tactics -- such as encrypting each message with
the recipient's public key -- that might prove difficult to filter by anyone
except the recipient. It remains to be seen which side will ultimately
prevail in this arms race.

</p><p><b>Counter-attack solutions.</b> Some people have responded to spam
by bombarding the sender or the sender’s ISP with complaints or false inquiries
about the advertised product. Such tactics can be automated, and can sometimes
pose an inconvenience for the spam sender. Many ISPs will revoke the accounts
of those who are the subject of spam complaints. However, as it is often 
difficult to determine the true sender of spam messages, technical
counter attacks sometimes go nowhere (often leaving a substantial trail
of bounced message notices) or land in the mail boxes of innocent victims
whose email addresses were misappropriated by unscrupulous spam senders.
Thus the effectiveness of such tactics is increasingly limited.

</p><p><b>Opt-out Lists.</b> Several email "opt-out" lists were established
in 1997. Individuals who do not wish to receive spam can ask to have their
email addresses included on these lists. The list maintainers ask bulk
emailers to "cleanse" their lists and remove all addresses that appear
on the opt-out lists. However, many people are suspicious of the opt-out
lists (in part due to the fact that some are run by bulk email companies),
and there is little evidence that these lists are widely used by bulk emailers
to cleanse their lists. Should companies with established brand names begin
using spam as a marketing tool, they would be more likely to use opt-out
lists than the companies that typically market with spam today.

</p><p><b>Channels.</b> The spam problem might be addressed through technologies
that sort incoming email according to sender, rejecting email from unknown
senders or placing it in a separate mailbox. Robert Hall, a researcher
at AT&amp;T Labs, developed a system of channelized electronic mail in
which individuals may assign a different channel to each of their correspondents
by giving each correspondent a unique email address at which to contact
them (Hall 98). Individuals can establish "public" channels, for example
to use on business cards, when submitting an email address to a Web site,
or when posting messages to public forums. Channels may be "revoked" and
all further messages sent to them bounced if they are used for spam. A
"personal channel agent" can help generate and keep track of an individual's
own channels as well as the addresses needed to contact other channel users
that the individual corresponds with. A similar tool is built into the
Lucent Personal Web Assistant (LPWA 97) to help users manage "target-revocable
email addresses" that are used when posting to newsgroups or submitting
an email address to a Web site.

</p><p>Individuals who adopt a channelized email system might find themselves
receiving significant amounts of spam on public channels but be unwilling
to revoke those channels because they are also used for unanticipated,
but desired, correspondence. As the amount of spam received on those channels
increases, it may not be practical to sort through them to find desired
messages. Even so, these individuals would still benefit from having mail
from known senders sorted into separate channels.

</p><p><b>Payments. </b>A channelized email system might be augmented so that
individuals may require "payments" before they read messages arriving on
certain channels. Such a payment might be in the form of electronic cash.
Optionally, if a message is from someone the individual wishes to correspond
with, such as a long lost friend, the individual might refund the payment.
This would make it more costly to send unsolicited email, and it would
compensate people for spending time reading this mail. To be practical,
however, this system would require the widespread adoption of compatible
digital payment systems. Another way to make it costly to send spam would
be to require "payments" of computation. Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor (1993)
have proposed a scheme that would require email senders "to compute a moderately
hard, but not intractable, function." Such computations could place a significant
burden on the computer resources of bulk mailers.

</p><p>A problem with the payment schemes described here as well as others
that have been proposed is that they generally require additional or augmented
protocols between both the email sender and the recipient and thus create
an "incremental adoption" problem. Any given
sender-recipient pair can implement these schemes using specialized software,
but guaranteed support for any scheme requires a change in Internet mail
standards and global adoption by every mail client. Incremental adoption
will always leave some users out in the cold; users who do decide
to adopt such a systems may discover that many of their correspondents
who send them desirable email have not adopted the system
and thus cannot easily comply with the payment request. This problem might
be reduced in a system that allows senders to "cut and paste" a computation
payment from a Java applet or other such software easily downloaded and
installed on the senders computer.

</p><p>Recently, Bell Labs researchers proposed a novel twist on email
payment schemes in which email senders perform time-consuming computations
as part of a "handshake" necessary to receive an "extended email address"
(similar to a channel address) for someone they wish to correspond with
(Gabber et al 1998). The handshake is initiated by sending mail to the
user's email address without any extensions. Once an extended email address
is received, it may be used repeatedly without need for the sender to engage
in further computation or use specialized email software. However, should
the sender use the extended email address to send unwanted mail, the recipient
can configure his or her client software to reject all future messages
sent to that address.

</p><p><b>Referral networks.</b> Another possible augmentation to a channelized
system would be a system of referral networks that would provide an automated
way for senders to be introduced or referred to people with whom they have
not previously corresponded. Referrals could be made in a variety of ways.
For example, senders who know someone who knows the intended recipient
could ask for a referral certificate from the common acquaintance, or professional
societies or clubs might provide certificates to refer their members to
each other. Individuals could configure their email software to accept
some types of referrals but not others, or prioritize messages according
to their referrals. We can also imagine special-purpose referral certificates
that might be useable only a finite number of times or that expire at a
certain time. However, in order for a referral system to be useful it must
be adopted by a critical mass of people.

</p><p><b>Fee restructuring.</b> Another proposed solution involves restructuring
the way fees are charged for Internet services. It has been suggested that
ISPs that generate large volumes of email pay the ISPs that receive that
email. The email generators would then have incentives to charge their
customers for sending large volumes of email. This solution would require
a lot of cooperation among ISPs and backbone providers, and may pose problems
for bulk mailers who send solicited email. It remains to be seen whether
fees can be structured such that a significant cost burden can be placed
on bulk mailers without making email prohibitively expensive for individuals.

</p><p>&nbsp;
</p><h2>
Regulatory solutions</h2>
Solutions to the spam problem are also being sought in the legislative
realm. Four bills have been introduced in Congress this session (two each
in the House of Representatives and the Senate); each suggests a different
approach to using Federal power to address the problem. The first spam
bill submitted this session, the "Netizens Protection Act of 1997" (Smith
-- H.R. 1748) would amend the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991
(which prohibits unsolicited facsimile communications) and make spam subject
to the same regulations as "junk fax." Unsolicited commercial email would
be banned and senders of solicited commercial e-mail would be required
to identify themselves on all communications. The constitutionality of
this approach is questionable, however; though commercial speech may be
regulated in limited cases<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#vi.%20See%20Central%20Hudson%20Gas%20and%20Electric%20Corp.%20v.">vi</a></sup>
the TCPA was found not to violate the First Amendment in part because of
the actual costs shifted from advertiser to recipient by junk fax and the
technological alternatives available at the time<sup><a href="http://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/spam/spam.html#vii.%20See%20Destination%20Ventures,%20Ltd.%20v.%20F.C.C.,%20844">vii</a></sup>.
Spam presents a different economic model with different costs and available
remedies.

<p>The "Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Choice Act of 1997" (Murkowski
-- S. 771) does not attempt to ban spam but rather force it to be uniformly
labeled and identified in an easily-filtered manner. (As such labels amount
to compelled speech this approach also raises constitutional questions.)
Commercial messages would be required to be labeled as "advertisements"
and senders of spam would have to provide "opt-out" methods under this
proposal. ISPs would be required to provide their users with email filtering
software that was sensitive to these labels. The bill would also grant
the FTC the power to seek injunctions and/or fines against spam generators
that did not properly label their message, and spam recipients would gain
a private cause of action.

</p><p>Another possible regulatory approach is to ban particular "bad-faith
actions" bulk mailers use to protect themselves. This is the goal of the
"Electronic Mailbox Protection Act of 1997"<sup> </sup>(Torricelli -- S.
875), which targets particular practices instead of attempting to ban all
spam. The bill would prohibit the transmission of unsolicited messages
from unregistered or fictitious domains and disguising the source of an
unsolicited message, in order to prevent replies. Bulk mailers would be
required to comply with "opt-out" requests, prohibited from sending spam
via third-party mail agents or from "harvesting" names and email addresses
from third-party systems in contravention to their respective policies
and terms of service agreements.

</p><p>Most recently, the "Data Privacy Act of 1997" (Tauzin -- H.R. 2368)
suggests that spam be controlled via the establishment of voluntary guidelines
for the behavior of bulk mailers. The guidelines would be established by
an industry working group (chartered by the legislation itself). Incentives
for adhering to the guidelines include "safe harbor" provisions with respect
to claims of unfair or deceptive trade practices on the part of the bulk
mailers and the right to identify oneself with an icon or logo as complying
with the guidelines. This approach obviously raises two questions: whether
the guidelines would be significant and whether anyone would actually choose
to adhere to them. Some anti-spam forces counter that this approach (and,
indeed, anything short of a total ban) may actually lead to an <i>increase</i>
in spam as such legislation will legitimize the practice of sending spam
and remove the associated stigma.

</p><p>
As this article was going to press, the U.S. Senate added anti-spam
provisions to legislation concerning telephone fraud (S. 1618) which
was subsequently passed and introduced into the House of
Representatives (H.R. 3888).  Title III of S. 1618 includes some of
the notice requirements of S. 771 (compelled identification of the
sender and maintenance of valid routing information) but does not
require any action on the part of ISPs.  Opponents of this legislation
argue that its passage would not only legitimize the practice of
sending unsolicited mail but would also allow each spammer "one free
shot" at Internet users as it requires only that spammers support an
opt-out procedure such as a "remove/no further contact" list.

</p><center>
<h2>
RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS</h2></center>
There is growing concern that the volume of spam sent each day may increase
substantially and that bulk mailers may adopt increasingly sophisticated
techniques to thwart automated filtering tools. If this occurs, current
filtering solutions are likely to become largely ineffective and many individuals
will likely become overwhelmed by spam to the point that their electronic
mailboxes are useless to them.

<p>Efforts to enforce existing laws as they apply to fraudulent practices
of some bulk emailers should be pursued, and the impacts of these efforts
should be studied. While proposed new laws may help slow the onset of a
severe spam problem, we do not believe they will be effective in the long
term and they are likely to cause undesirable side effects. On the other
hand, technical solutions that may have limited effectiveness right now
may prove quite useful should a severe problem arise. In addition to continued
filtering efforts by ISPs, we recommend that user-friendly email software
be developed that supports a multi-pronged technical solution that includes
filters, channels, payments, and referral networks. Those features that
will not cause people to risk missing desired messages can be activated
immediately. As the spam problem gets worse, more risky features can be
activated by individuals who find the cost of spam exceeds the costs of
potentially missing some desired messages.

</p><p>Finally, we end with a cautionary note. In selecting solutions to pursue,
it is important to keep in mind possible side effects. For example, per-message
fees could make email prohibitively expensive for a variety of desirable
applications, legal requirements on identifying email senders might limit
legitimate anonymous communications, and channelized email and referral
networks might result in increased entry barriers to social networks. The
properties that make email so appealing to marketers have also served to
make email an effective tool for political organizers, academic communities,
social networks, and individuals. In attempting to prevent spam from destroying
email as a useful medium, we should be careful not to adopt solutions that
will undermine the very aspects of email that we value.

<a name="Sidebar 1: A Case"></a>Sidebar 1: A Case Study</h2>
In order to better understand the extent of the spam problem, we analyzed
mailer logs for selected AT&amp;T and Lucent sub-domains for a six-month
period beginning at the end of April 1997. These domains receive about
70,000 email messages from the Internet during a typical week. We also
studied the spam problem for an Internet Service Provider during a two-week
period in July 1997 in which the service processed over 13 million email
messages from the Internet.

<p>During the study period, email administrators at AT&amp;T and Lucent
used a variety of automated and semi-automated filtering mechanisms to
identify and block spam messages intended for their employees. The filters
were updated on a regular basis (often daily), a process that generally
consumed between 4 and 20 hours of administrator time each week. We compiled
statistics on the number of messages blocked each day for all the sub-domains
under study. For one sub-domain we compiled the number of addresses for
which spam was blocked each day, and the number of messages blocked for
each address. Using information reported by employees who voluntarily saved
all the spam messages they received, we monitored the accuracy of the spam
filters. We estimate that the filters blocked at least half the spam messages
received during the entire study period. During the last half of the study
period, we estimate the filters blocked between 60 and 80 percent of the
spam messages.

</p><p>At the beginning of the study period at the end of April, we blocked
2.5% of the messages received from the Internet on the sub-domains under
study. Thus, we estimate that at that time spam comprised no more than
5% of the total messages received from the Internet. This percentage had
doubled by the end of June. At its peak, we estimate the weekly spam percentage
exceeded 15%. The percentage of spam received dipped significantly at the
end of September through the beginning of October during the period when
Cyber Promotions lost its Internet connectivity. The spam rate began increasing
again after the first week of October. The number of messages blocked each
day during the study period are shown in Figure 1.

<p>Because the majority of email received in a business setting is received
during the work week rather than on weekends, the spam percentage on weekends
was consistently significantly higher than the spam percentage on weekdays.
The actual number of spam messages received each day on weekends was generally
about the same as the number of spam messages received each day during
the work week. While we observed that fewer email messages were received
on US national holidays, we did not observe a decrease in the number of
spam messages received on those days.

</p><p>In addition to increases in the total number of spam messages, the number
of addresses that received spam messages also increased substantially during
the study period. At the end of April, approximately 14% of the addresses
receiving mail during a given week received some spam mail. This percentage
increased to over 31% by the week of October 20. Furthermore, while no
single address received more than an estimated 20 spam messages each week
at the end of April, just prior to the Cyber Promotions outage some addresses
were receiving an estimated 80 spam messages each week.

</p><p>In order to gain some insight into why some people were receiving an
ever increasing quantity of spam while others were receiving none, we examined
the 55 addresses that received the most spam during the first half of our
study and compared them with 55 addresses randomly selected from those
that received at least 50 email messages during that period. We looked
up the "high spam" and "random" address in two online Web indexes &#150; AltaVista
and HotBot – and in Deja News, an index of Usenet news. We recorded the
number of "hits" returned for each address. The random address had an average
of 3 hits in AltaVista, 6 hits in HotBot, and 7 hits in Deja News, while
the high spam addresses had an average of 13 hits in AltaVista, 30 hits
in HotBot, and 99 hits in Deja News. Furthermore, the high spam addresses
were 1.5 times more likely than the random addresses to have any hits in
either of the Web indexes, and 3.2 times more likely to have any hits in
Deja News. The high spam addresses were 4.6 times more likely than the
random addresses to have hits in all three indexes. This data suggests
that people who have indexed Web pages or post frequently to USENET are
more likely to receive spam than those who do not. Although we have not
demonstrated a causal relationship with this data, the existence of automated
tools to "harvest" email addresses from the Web and USENET suggests that
having an indexed Web page or posting frequently may actually cause one
to receive spam, rather than simply being a characteristic of those who
receive spam. However, Web page owners and frequent posters may also be
likely to engage in other online activities that may trigger spam. Also,
it is also not clear whether having an indexed Web page is really a major
contributing factor for receiving spam, or whether having an indexed Web
page is simply a characteristic of many people who post frequently to USENET.

</p><p>While it was not possible to track down the creation date for all the
addresses in the sub-domains under study, the addresses in one sub-domain
were known to be mostly obsolete, and the addresses in another were known
to have been created within the past two years. The highest levels of spam
were generally received on the oldest sub-domain, while the lowest levels
of spam were generally received on the newest sub-domain. Several employees
who have multiple email addresses reported to us that they tended to receive
more spam at their older addresses.

</p><p>
Preliminary analysis of data collected after the end of our
six-month study period indicates that the performance of our filters
has degraded considerably over the past few months, apparently due to
spammers' changing tactics (and little effort on our part to keep up).
In addition, the amount of spam we receive each day appears to be
leveling off.

</p><p><b><font size="+2">Sidebar 2: What does spam advertise?</font></b>

</p><p>As part of our study, we analyzed a collection of 400 unique messages
sent to the AT&amp;T and Lucent sub-domains under study during March, April,
and May 1997 and identified by email administrators as spam. We classified
the messages in this collection according to the types of products or services
they advertised and recorded several other characteristics of each message.
Fifty of the messages were then classified by another rater. The classifications
by the two raters agreed 82 percent of the time.

</p><p>Figure 2 shows the types of products advertised by the spam we analyzed.
Thirty-six percent of the messages in our collection advertised money-making
opportunities, including pyramid-style schemes, multi-level marketing systems,
and investment opportunities. Eleven percent advertised adult entertainment,
singles services, and sexually-oriented products and services. Ten percent
advertised direct email marketing products and services, including bulk
email services, lists of email addresses, and software for harvesting email
addresses or sending out bulk mailings. Nine percent advertised informational
and how-to guides. Seven percent advertised Internet services and various
computer hardware and software products, office supplies and machinery,
and related services. Three percent were either non-commercial messages
or suspected to have been solicited by the recipient. The remaining messages
advertised other products and services, including phone services, vacation
packages, nutritional supplements, weight loss products, credit cards,
cable descramblers, and online newsletters.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>Only 36% of the messages contained instructions for being removed from
the mailing list -- and reports from email administrators suggest that
many of these instructions are likely faulty or deliberately misleading.
Perhaps most telling about the nature of these messages was the fact that
fewer than 10 percent identified the name, postal address, phone number,
and email address of the sender, as per the Direct Marketing Association
guidelines (see <a href="http://www.the-dma.org/home_pages/business-affairs/onlinebd.html">http://www.the-dma.org/home_pages/business-affairs/onlinebd.html</a>).
Such identification would be required by Title III of S. 1618.

<p>The low percentage of identified senders and our observations about
the types of products and services being offered support the general perception
among spam recipients that most spam is not coming from "legitimate businesses."
Indeed spam recipients often complain that spam is particularly annoying
to them because so much of it advertises adult entertainment and possibly-fraudulent
schemes. When H. Robert Weintzen, President of the DMA, spoke at the June
1997 FTC workshop about spam he said, "Most legitimate marketers are afraid
to be associated with it." Others at the workshop expressed concern that
a fear of spam would deter people from engaging in electronic commerce.

Sidebar 3: What You Can Do About Spam</h2>
If you are annoyed or inconvenienced by spam, you might want to take action
to reduce the amount of spam you receive. There is a growing number of
spam filtering tools available for sale and for free. Check the Web page
for your email client to see if there are any tools designed specifically
to work with that client. Yahoo has a list of anti-spam software at <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Communications_and_Networking/Electronic_Mail/Junk_Email/Software/">http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Communications_and_Networking/Electronic_Mail/Junk_Email/Software/</a>

<p>If your email client has built in filtering capabilities, you might
try some simple spam filtering tricks such as identifying messages that
are not addressed directly to you and sending them to a separate "junk"
folder. This will catch a large percentage of spam messages, but it will
also catch some legitimate messages, so make sure you look through your
junk folder periodically before emptying it. You can improve the accuracy
of this filter by setting up other folders for your legitimate mailing
list mail and adding new filtering rules as you discover misfiled messages.

</p><p>If you can’t filter all the spam you receive, complaining about spam
might help you feel better, and it might ultimately lead to legal action
against some spammers. For information on identifying the source of spam
messages and tips on who to complain to about spam, see Phil Agre’s "How
to Complain About Spam, or, Put a Spammer in the Slammer" at <a href="http://weber.ucsd.edu/~pagre/spam.html">http://weber.ucsd.edu/~pagre/spam.html</a>.
